1. Objective:
   - Build a text classification model to identify harmful or offensive content in social media comments.

2. Dataset:
   - Data stored in an Excel file ('your_dataset.xlsx').

3. Preprocessing:
   - Remove HTML tags, extract emoticons, convert text to lowercase, and combine emoticons back into the text.

4. Tokenization and Vectorization:
   - Tokenize text using stemming and remove English stopwords.
   - Use HashingVectorizer for vectorization.

5. Model:
   - Train a Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) classifier with logistic loss.

6. Training:
   - Split the dataset into training and testing sets.
   - Train the model using the partial fit method for incremental learning.

7. Evaluation:
   - Print accuracy on the test set.

8. Inference:
   - Use the trained model for predictions on new examples in both English and Bengali.
   - Output the predicted class and probability.

9. Project Structure:
   - Organized into directories: data, models, src, notebooks.
   - Notebooks for exploratory data analysis, model training, and inference.

10. Dependencies:
    - NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-learn, TQDM, NLTK.

11. Model Persistence:
    - Save the trained model as 'trained_model.pkl'.

12. Usage:
    - Set up dependencies using 'requirements.txt'.
    - Explore data, train the model, and make predictions using Jupyter notebooks.
